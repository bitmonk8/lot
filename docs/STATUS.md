# Project Status

## Current Phase

**Implementation and audit remediation complete** across all platforms (Linux, macOS, Windows). CI pipeline covers format, clippy, build, and test on all 3 platforms. Tests run in parallel (default thread count).

## Issues (2026-03-23)

All audit findings resolved. Groups 1, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 10 closed.

## CI Notes

Ubuntu 24.04 requires `sysctl -w kernel.apparmor_restrict_unprivileged_userns=0` to allow unprivileged user namespace creation. The CI already sets this.
