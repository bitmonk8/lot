# Project Status

## Current Phase

**Complete.** Implementation and audit remediation finished across all platforms (Linux, macOS, Windows). CI pipeline covers format, clippy, build, and test on all 3 platforms.

## Issues (2026-03-22)

All 82 audit findings resolved. See `docs/ISSUES.md`.

## CI Notes

Ubuntu 24.04 requires `sysctl -w kernel.apparmor_restrict_unprivileged_userns=0` to allow unprivileged user namespace creation. The CI already sets this.
